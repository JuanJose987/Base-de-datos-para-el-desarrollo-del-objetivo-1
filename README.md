# Database of bibliographic study on taphonomic and entomological factors involved in changes in human tissue buried at shallow depths

Thank you for your interest in interacting with this database to nurture your research.

# Description

To develop the first part of the research process, the following search equations were applied:  

- Combination number 1: (cambios tafonómicos OR tafonomía) AND (tejido enterrado a baja profundidad NOT tejido expuesto). 

- Combination number 2: (cambios entomológicos OR entomología) AND (tejido enterrado a baja profundidad NOT tejido expuesto).

- Combination number 3: (cambios tafonómicos OR factores tafonómicos) AND (cambios entomológicos OR factores entomológicos) AND (tejido enterrado a baja profundidad NOT tejido expuesto) AND (condiciones edafoclimáticas).

The documents obtained after the application of the search equations were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in such a way that for word combination number 1 a total of 6 words were found, for combination 2 there were 10, combination 3 there were 15, in total: 31, but 7 of these were repeated, and of these 24, 10 were not useful because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, 14 were left: 3 from combination number 1, 4 from combination number 2 and 7 from combination number 3. These documents are contained in each of the branches that make up this project; in addition, in the main branch there is an Excel file with the Sistema Tabular de Información that synthesizes all the information used for this study.
